## What you can find in this repository

Here, you will find the books that I have read about image processing and computer vision, notes and useful python programs that you analize and run in your compute, understaing how image process works and learning how modules like pillow e cv2 work (open CV).

## Requirements

* Python interpreter
* Numpy ```pip3 install numpy```
* [CV2: Linux demo installation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html) 
* matplotlib: 2D plotting library.
* SciPy: another scientifi Python library.
* libfreenects:module by OpenKinect projec. It provides drivers and libraries for the Microsoft KInect hardware.
* NumPy: package for scientific computing.
* Pillow ```pip install pillow```
* PyGame ```sudo apt-get install python-pygame``` . Pygams can be used to manage groups of AI entities, draw text, draw 2D geometry, caputre events relating to windows, keyboard, mouse and gamepads. Playback and synthesist of source and music.
*Imutis: OpenCV face regnotions ```pip install --upgrade imutils```
